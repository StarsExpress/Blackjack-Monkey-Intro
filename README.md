# Why This Repo Is Named "Monkey" 🤔
🐒 Monkeys refer to face cards (J, Q, K) & 10. 10-valued cards are super impactful on game results.

With more playing, you will see why you want monkeys to be your friends 😎

# Demos 🖥️
Now let's dive into some demos 🤓

### Simple Manipulation ⌨
How you "fill online forms" is how you play this game.

Always scroll down for more content of a single tab.

### Home Page
Enter your capital amount and everything is set.
